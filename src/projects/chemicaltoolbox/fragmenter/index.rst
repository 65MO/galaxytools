This illustration shows a workflow that is
implemented in the ChemicalToolBoX. It
fragmentizes an input library according
to predefined rules (e.g. RECAP_) and
labels the broken bonds (red dots). In
the next step it merges the fragments
according to predefined synthetic rules
to form new promising compounds that
enlarge the known chemical space.
The fragmentation of 1,425 approved
drugs yields 1,895 unique fragments that
build the foundation of 150,642 unique
drug-like compounds.
