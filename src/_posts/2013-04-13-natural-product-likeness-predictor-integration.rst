From the `natural product likeness scorer`_ paper:

The natural product likeness scorer implemented by Peter Ertl [#]_ was originally 
devised to screen large compound libraries for natural product likeness in 
drug designing studies. His work is re-implemented using open source and open 
data to validate natural product likeness of theoretical metabolite structures 
in computer assisted structure elucidation.

And its now included in ChemicalToolBoX.

It's Java based. So fire up your Java Virtual Machine on
your server and install it via the toolshed.
