**What does this tool do?**

  This tool computes the Euclidean distance between the Spectrophores(TM) descriptors of the target to each molecule stored in the library.

**Tip:** this tool is useful to select compounds with similar chemical features to a target, but accounting for the discovery of diverse scaffolds. This is in contrast to the results expected in a similarity search based on atom connectivity.

**Hint:** the target molecule MUST BE an sdf formatted file with the Spectrophores(TM) descriptors stored as meta-data. Such file can be generated using the "Compute physico-chemical properties" tool.

**Hint:** the library of compounds is a tabular formatted file with 1 line / compound. One column contains the Spectrophores(TM) descriptors.

**Spectrophores(TM)** are Silicos' screening technology which converts three-dimensional molecular property data into one-dimensional spectra. Typical characteristics that can be converted include electrostatic potentials, molecular shape, lipophilicity, hardness and softness potentials. The computation of Spectrophores(TM) is independent of the position and orientation of a molecule and this allows to easily compare Spectrophores(TM) of different molecules.

Molecules with similar three-dimensional properties and shape, and therefore also similar biological activities, always have similar Spectrophores(TM), and as a result this technique is very powerful as a tool to investigate the similarity of molecules and can be applied as a screening tool for molecular databases, virtual screening, and databse characterisations.

**Advantages:**

    * Spectrophores(TM) can realistically compute ligand-protein interactions based on aforementioned molecular descriptors.
    * Spectrophores(TM) can be applied in both a ligand- or target-based setting.
    * Spectrophores(TM) can distinguish, if needed, between the different enantiomers of stereo-selective compounds.
    * Spectrophores(TM) can be computed fast.
